# Stage 2 · ICML Refine Skill (Template Extension)

Apply the shared template first:

- `skills/stage2/template/SKILL.md`

Then apply only the ICML-specific overrides below.

## ICML overrides

- Preserve the same strict JSON schema and output format from the template.
- Keep ICML naming in labels and internal references when conference name is explicitly mentioned.
- Keep style target concise, precise, and submission-ready for top-tier ML rebuttal response quality.

## ICML note

No additional structural override is required beyond conference labeling. All writing constraints, opener rules, normalization rules, and hard constraints are inherited from the base template.
