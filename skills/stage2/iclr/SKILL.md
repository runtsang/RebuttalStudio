# Stage 2 · ICLR Refine Skill (Template Extension)

Apply the shared template first:

- `skills/stage2/template/SKILL.md`

Then apply only the ICLR-specific overrides below.

## ICLR overrides

- Preserve the same strict JSON schema and output format from the template.
- Keep ICLR naming in labels and internal references when conference name is explicitly mentioned.
- Keep style target concise, precise, and submission-ready for a top-tier ML rebuttal.

## ICLR note

No additional structural override is required beyond conference labeling. All writing constraints, opener rules, normalization rules, and hard constraints are inherited from the base template.
