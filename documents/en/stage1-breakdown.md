# Stage 1 - Breakdown

## What this stage is for

Turn one long reviewer comment into smaller, answerable issues so you do not miss anything.

## How to use it

1. Paste one reviewer's full comment in the left panel.
2. Click `Break down`.
3. Check the structured results on the right.
4. Use `＋` to add missing issues, or `Split` to break one large issue into two.
5. When the issue list looks clean, move to Stage 2.

## What you should get

- A clear issue list that can be answered item by item.
