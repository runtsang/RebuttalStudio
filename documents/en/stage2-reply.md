# Stage 2 - Reply

## What this stage is for

Write quick outlines first, then polish them into formal rebuttal drafts.

## How to use it

1. In `My Reply`, write key points for each issue (not necessarily formal yet).
2. If needed, right-click to insert a `Table` or `Code` block.
3. Click `Refine` to generate polished drafts in `Refined Draft`.
4. Manually edit the generated text to match your actual claims.
5. Move to Stage 3 after every issue has a usable draft.

## What you should get

- A polished draft response for each issue.
