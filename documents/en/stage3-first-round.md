# Stage 3 - First Round

## What this stage is for

Assemble your per-issue replies into first-round submission-ready text.

## How to use it

1. Review each response for tone and formatting.
2. Use formatting tools (bold/italic/color/headings) where needed.
3. Switch to `All` to view the full reply for this reviewer.
4. Check `Total words`; if too long, click `To break down` to split into parts.
5. Copy the final text (or split parts) to your rebuttal platform.

## What you should get

- One complete first-round response (or multiple copy-ready chunks).
